# Replication of Sieg and Yoon (2017)

> This replication study was part of our evaluation for the course [Numerical Methods](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/) at SciencesPo Paris in Spring 2021

In this replication study, we take advantage of Julia in order to model dynamic games by using a standard semi- parametric approach. Please note that while we find almost identical results in terms of model solutions for the numerical values, the differences in simulation results are larger.

As the authors themselves explain in their Readme file accompanying their code, this is because a randomly drawn politician can be classified as a different type of governor even with small differences in election standards.

You will find our documentation here.
